# Evaluating the Relationship between Stock Market Trends and Social Media Feeds
* Datalogy group's Final Project, UofT Data Analytics Bootcapm, April-Sept 2021.

## Overview

In this analysis we are trying to implement a machine learning model to predict trends in segments of stock market based on the effects of certain celebrities' interaction with the market through their social media feeds. To do so we are going to feed the model with APIs from Twitter and historical data from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks) Stocks Market values in a 10-year time interval. 

We selected Twitter feeds and Bloomberg data as they are real world data with a noticeable complexity in their nature which could be regarded appropriate to use for a machine learning model created to statistically verify any significant correlation between the two entities.
