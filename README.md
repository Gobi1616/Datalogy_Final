# Evaluating the Relationship between Stock Market Trends and Social Media Feeds
* Datalogy Final Project, UofT Data Analytics Bootcamp, April-Sept 2021.

## Overview

In this analysis we are trying to implement a machine learning model to predict trends in segments of stock market based on the effects of certain celebrities' interaction with the market through their social media feeds. To do so, we are going to feed the model with an API from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en) and historical data from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks) Stocks Market values encompassing a 10-year time interval. 

We selected Twitter feeds and Bloomberg data as they are real world data with a noticeable complexity in their nature, which could be regarded appropriate to use for a machine learning model created to statistically verify any significant correlation between the two entities.

To pragmatically carry out the analysis we need to be more specific and select a segment of the stock market and focus on Twitter feeds from a world-renowned entrepreneur to minimize any confounding factors. 

To discard or minimize any probable similarities with any other project, we will be using Bloomberg stock market dataset, a time interval of our choosing that will be uniques to this project, and statistical approach most fit for our dataset and case. 

## Data Sources

   ### Bloomberg
The Bloomberg Professional Software is being using to fetch the historical data for Tesla Stock price from 2011 till date. 





   ### Twitter API

This project streams real-time data from Twitter, performs natural language processing on the contents of the tweet, and displays the results. The Twitter data is filtered by a query word and processed to determine sentiment of the tweet.

In this study, we use data from such a powerful microblogging platform to examine how a digital behemoth, a global icon, may influence the emotions of millions of people connected to it, and how these feelings, in turn, affect the rise and fall of an organization's stock price. Aside from being a fantastic communication tool, Twitter is a gold mine for text and social web analysis.

## Study Questions we hope to answer with the data
We strive to answer the following questions through the implementation of the proposed machine learning model:

     1- How do tweets impact the stock prices? - The Analysis will be based on Elon Musk's Twitter account and Tesla Stock Prices over the period under consideration.
     2- Are there any keywords which actually make an impact on Tesla stock price?
     3-The greatest increase in the stock price and greatest decrease.
     4- Is an invidual twitter's tweet are significant to move the market?
     5- The model of bag-of-words is being used for Machine Learning
     


## Communication Protocol
There are four members in our team. The role of each team member will vary every week to ensure that everyone can gain experience in different areas of the project. A slack channel was created to support communication amongst the team, and will be used to assign tickets, provide updates, and discuss any issues. The team will additionally have zoom meetings everyday to go over project progress and next steps.
We also created a WhatsApp group to follow up with the team and a shared folder in google drive to save the resources.
