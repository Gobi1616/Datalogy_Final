* Datalogy group's Final Project for UofT Data Analytics Bootcapm, April-Sept 2021.

## Overview

In this analysis we are trying to implement a machine learning model to predict trends in segments of stock market based on the effects of certain celebrities' interaction with the market through their social media feeds. To do so we are going to feed the model with APIs from Twitter and historicl data from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks) Stocks Market values in 10 year time interval. We selected Twitter feeds and Bloomberg data as they are real world data with a noticeable coplexity in their nature to test our machine learning project to analyze the data to statistically verifiy any significant correlation.
