# Evaluating the Relationship between Stock Market Trends and Social Media Feeds
* Datalogy Final Project, UofT Data Analytics Bootcamp, April-Sept 2021.

## Overview

In this analysis we are trying to implement a machine learning model to predict trends in segments of stock market based on the effects of certain celebrities' interaction with the market through their social media feeds. To do so, we are going to feed the model with an API from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/?lang=en) and historical data from [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/stocks) Stocks Market values encompassing a 10-year time interval. 

We selected Twitter feeds and Bloomberg data as they are real world data with a noticeable complexity in their nature, which could be regarded appropriate to use for a machine learning model created to statistically verify any significant correlation between the two entities.

To pragmatically carry out the analysis we need to be more specific and select a segment of the stock market and focus on Twitter feeds from a world-renowned entrepreneur to minimize any confounding factors. To discard any notion that our project might have some similarities in approach with other projects at the first glance, but we affirm that we are using a data sources of our choice, Bloomberg, different time frames and statistical approach we see fit for the case. 

## Data Sources

### Bloomberg






### Twitter API



## Study Questions we hope to answer with the data
We strive to answer the following questions through the implementation of this machine learning model:

  1- Could Social media, in general, impact the stock market?
  2- Could Social media, in particular Twitter feeds, impact certain segments of the stock market?
  3- 
  4-
  5-
